SkyBlock Dupe Tracker (SBDT) is a sophisticated Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 mod created by Brxnwies. It is designed to track and prevent item duplication in the Hypixel Skyblock game.

## Getting Started

#### Installing Forge

1. Launch Minecraft 1.8.9 and wait for the title screen to appear, then close the game.
2. Install Minecraft **1.8.9** forge from the [official Forge website](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html).
   - Click the installer download link, and when prompted, click the `skip ad` button in the top right corner of the pop-up window.
3. Run the installer, select "install client," and complete the installation process.
4. In the Minecraft launcher, create a new installation under the `installations` tab, selecting version `1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.xxxx` (usually located at the bottom).
5. Launch the newly created installation, wait for the title screen, and then close it.

#### Installing the SkyBlock Dupe Tracker Mod (SBDT)

1. Download the latest SBDT mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/brxnwies/SBDT/releases). If you encounter a warning about the file's safety, click `allow anyway` as all Java files are flagged by some browsers.
2. Install the SBDT mod:
   - If you have Java installed, double-click the downloaded file and click "install."
   - If not, press the Windows key + R, type `%appdata%`, open the `.minecraft` folder, and locate the `mods` folder. Drag and drop the downloaded mod file into this folder.
3. Open the Minecraft launcher and launch the Forge installation you set up earlier.
4. Access Skyblock and run the command `/api new`. Your API key will be automatically filled, and all SBDT features should be active.
5. Type `/sbdt`. If you see the SkyBlock Dupe Tracker menu, you've completed the setup correctly!
